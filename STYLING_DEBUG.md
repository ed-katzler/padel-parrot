# Styling Debug Guide

## ✅ Server Status
- Server is running correctly on http://localhost:3000
- CSS is being generated and served properly
- HTML classes are being applied correctly

## 🔍 Debug Steps

### 1. Hard Refresh Browser
**Chrome/Edge:** `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
**Safari:** `Cmd+Option+R`
**Firefox:** `Ctrl+F5`

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Right-click on refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 3. Check Network Tab
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh page
4. Look for CSS files (should show 200 status)

### 4. Incognito/Private Window
- Open http://localhost:3000 in an incognito/private window
- This bypasses all cached styles

### 5. Developer Tools Console
- Check for any CSS-related errors in console
- Look for 404 errors for static assets

## 🎯 Expected Behavior
The app should show:
- Clean, modern UI with rounded corners
- Blue primary colors
- Proper spacing and typography
- Responsive design

## 🔧 Quick Fix Commands
If styling still doesn't work, run these:

```bash
# Stop server and clear all caches
pkill -f "next dev"
cd apps/web
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npm run dev
```

## 📱 Current CSS Status
- ✅ Tailwind CSS configured correctly
- ✅ Global styles loaded
- ✅ CSS file being served at /_next/static/css/app/layout.css
- ✅ HTML classes being applied

If you're still seeing unstyled content, it's likely a browser caching issue.
